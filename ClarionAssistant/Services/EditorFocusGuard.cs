    /// GH #140: decides whether a Monaco surface may claim keyboard focus, or must stand down
    /// because the user has deliberately focused a NON-DOCUMENT IDE surface (a docked pad such as
    /// the Output pane). The #66 tab-activation hooks re-claim focus for the WebView2 whenever the
    /// workbench re-selects the Monaco document window — but the fork re-fires WindowSelected on
    /// every click into a pad while a Monaco document stays active (confirmed via monaco-spike.log:
    /// one claim per Output-pane click), so the pad goes deaf: scroll still works (hover-routed)
    /// but clicks/selection/Ctrl+A die (focus-routed). The CA Find pad previously won this same
    /// fight only via a bespoke timed suppression (CaFindBroker.SuppressEditorFocusSteal); this
    /// guard is the general rule so every other pad is safe by default.
    ///
    /// Classification walks the ancestry of the control that currently HOLDS Win32 focus:
    ///  - inside the claiming Monaco control → claim (harmless, focus is already ours);
    ///  - a pad wrapper / auto-hide host / non-Document dock pane → STAND DOWN;
    ///  - a Document-state dock pane (another editor tab, the document tab strip) → claim — that
    ///    is precisely the legit #66 scenario (tab switch), which must keep claiming;
    ///  - unclassified (unknown fork types, or a native hwnd with no managed wrapper) → claim,
    ///    i.e. pre-guard behavior — the guard can only make focus LESS grabby, never more.
    /// Type checks are name-based (PadContentWrapper / AutoHide / DockPane.DockState via
    /// reflection): the SD-fork surface differs from upstream SharpDevelop, so unclassified chains
    /// are spike-logged (throttled) to let us add real fork type names instead of guessing.
